	abstract = {We present a study on the trapping of hard ferromagnetic particles using alternating magnetic fields, with a focus on planar trap geometries. First, we realize and characterize a magnetic Paul trap design for millimeter-size magnets based on a rotating magnetic potential. Employing a physically rotating platform with two pairs of permanent magnets with opposite poles, we show stable trapping of hard ferromagnets a centimeter above the trap and demonstrate that the particle shape plays a critical role in the trapping. Finally, we propose a chip trap design that will open a path to studies of gyromagnetic effects with ferromagnetic microparticles.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we present an experimental realisation of a double loop type Magnetic Paul Trap. We show that a microgram heavy {NdFeB} permanent magnet can stably be levitated for hours at room temperature in this trap. Magnetic levitation of a magnetized particle is theoretically possible with this trap by generating opposed alternating magnetic fields. We show the fabrication of a printed circuit structure capable of producing these fields, as well as the engineering behind the realisation of the trap. Both by optical and magnetic readout we characterize the motion of the trapped magnet and show that its center of mass motion frequencies ωz = 2ωx,y ≈ 20Hz. We characterize the damping on these modes and find that at low pressure the quality factor is strongly limited (to Q ≈ 90) by coupling to the environment through generation of Eddy currents.},
