	abstract = {We present a study on the trapping of hard ferromagnetic particles using alternating magnetic fields, with a focus on planar trap geometries. First, we realize and characterize a magnetic Paul trap design for millimeter-size magnets based on a rotating magnetic potential. Employing a physically rotating platform with two pairs of permanent magnets with opposite poles, we show stable trapping of hard ferromagnets a centimeter above the trap and demonstrate that the particle shape plays a critical role in the trapping. Finally, we propose a chip trap design that will open a path to studies of gyromagnetic effects with ferromagnetic microparticles.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we present an experimental realisation of a double loop type Magnetic Paul Trap. We show that a microgram heavy {NdFeB} permanent magnet can stably be levitated for hours at room temperature in this trap. Magnetic levitation of a magnetized particle is theoretically possible with this trap by generating opposed alternating magnetic fields. We show the fabrication of a printed circuit structure capable of producing these fields, as well as the engineering behind the realisation of the trap. Both by optical and magnetic readout we characterize the motion of the trapped magnet and show that its center of mass motion frequencies ωz = 2ωx,y ≈ 20Hz. We characterize the damping on these modes and find that at low pressure the quality factor is strongly limited (to Q ≈ 90) by coupling to the environment through generation of Eddy currents.},

	abstract = {This chapter is intended as a pedagogical introduction to the dynamics of optically levitated nanoparticles with a focus on the study of single particle thermodynamics. Much of the work studying thermodynamics with nano- and micro-particles has taken place in liquid, and this chapter will avoid reviewing this impressive body of work, focussing instead on studies of thermodynamics with nanoparticles levitated in a gas. For a recent literature review we refer the reader to Gieseler \& Millen Entropy 20, 326 (2018). The authors will discuss extensions into the quantum regime where relevant throughout the chapter.},

While available definitions of Q are often limited to linear resonators or oscillators with specific topologies, our definition is applicable to any oscillator as a figure of merit for its amplitude stability. It can be formulated rigorously and computed numerically from oscillator equations. With this definition, we calculate and analyze the Q factors of several oscillators of different types. The results confirm that the proposed Q formulation is a useful addition to the characterization techniques for oscillators.},
