	abstract = {We present a study on the trapping of hard ferromagnetic particles using alternating magnetic fields, with a focus on planar trap geometries. First, we realize and characterize a magnetic Paul trap design for millimeter-size magnets based on a rotating magnetic potential. Employing a physically rotating platform with two pairs of permanent magnets with opposite poles, we show stable trapping of hard ferromagnets a centimeter above the trap and demonstrate that the particle shape plays a critical role in the trapping. Finally, we propose a chip trap design that will open a path to studies of gyromagnetic effects with ferromagnetic microparticles.},

	abstract = {In this thesis we present an experimental realisation of a double loop type Magnetic Paul Trap. We show that a microgram heavy {NdFeB} permanent magnet can stably be levitated for hours at room temperature in this trap. Magnetic levitation of a magnetized particle is theoretically possible with this trap by generating opposed alternating magnetic fields. We show the fabrication of a printed circuit structure capable of producing these fields, as well as the engineering behind the realisation of the trap. Both by optical and magnetic readout we characterize the motion of the trapped magnet and show that its center of mass motion frequencies ωz = 2ωx,y ≈ 20Hz. We characterize the damping on these modes and find that at low pressure the quality factor is strongly limited (to Q ≈ 90) by coupling to the environment through generation of Eddy currents.},

While available definitions of Q are often limited to linear resonators or oscillators with specific topologies, our definition is applicable to any oscillator as a figure of merit for its amplitude stability. It can be formulated rigorously and computed numerically from oscillator equations. With this definition, we calculate and analyze the Q factors of several oscillators of different types. The results confirm that the proposed Q formulation is a useful addition to the characterization techniques for oscillators.},

	abstract = {Understanding gravity in the framework of quantum mechanics is one of the great challenges in modern physics. However, the lack of empirical evidence has lead to a debate on whether gravity is a quantum entity. Despite varied proposed probes for quantum gravity, it is fair to say that there are no feasible ideas yet to test its quantum coherent behavior directly in a laboratory experiment. Here, we introduce an idea for such a test based on the principle that two objects cannot be entangled without a quantum mediator. We show that despite the weakness of gravity, the phase evolution induced by the gravitational interaction of two micron size test masses in adjacent matter-wave interferometers can detectably entangle them even when they are placed far apart enough to keep Casimir-Polder forces at bay. We provide a prescription for witnessing this entanglement, which certifies gravity as a quantum coherent mediator, through simple spin correlation measurements.},

	abstract = {Observing and controlling macroscopic quantum systems has long been a driving force in quantum physics research. In particular, strong coupling between individual quantum systems and mechanical oscillators is being actively studied1–3. Whereas both read-out of mechanical motion using coherent control of spin systems4–9 and single-spin read-out using pristine oscillators have been demonstrated10,11, temperature control of the motion of a macroscopic object using long-lived electronic spins has not been reported. Here we observe a spin-dependent torque and spin-cooling of the motion of a trapped microdiamond. Using a combination of microwave and laser excitation enables the spins of nitrogen–vacancy centres to act on the diamond orientation and to cool the diamond libration via a dynamical back-action. Furthermore, by driving the system in the nonlinear regime, we demonstrate bistability and self-sustained coherent oscillations stimulated by spin–mechanical coupling, which offers the prospect of spin-driven generation of non-classical states of motion. Such a levitating diamond—held in position by electric field gradients   under vacuum—can operate as a ‘compass’ with controlled dissipation and has potential use in high-precision torque sensing12–14, emulation of the spin-boson problem15 and probing of quantum phase transitions16. In the single-spin limit17 and using ultrapure nanoscale diamonds, it could allow quantum non-demolition read-out of the spin of nitrogen–vacancy centres at ambient conditions, deterministic entanglement between distant individual spins18 and matter-wave interferometry16,19,20.},

These librational frequencies largely exceed the decoherence rate of {NV} centers in typical {CVD} grown diamonds offering prospects for sideband resolved operation. We also prepare and levitate composite diamond-ferromagnet particles and demonstrate both coherent spin control of the {NV} centers and read-out of the particle libration using the {NV} spin.
