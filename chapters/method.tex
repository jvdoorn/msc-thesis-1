\subsection{Sample fabrication}
A \qty{9}{\mm} by \qty{5}{\mm} undoped \ce{Si} wafer of \qty{500}{\um} thick is used as a substrate. The substrate is spincoated at \qty{2000}{\rpm} with positive resist AR P 662.06 and baked at \qty{150}{\celsius} for \qty{3}{\min}. This step is then repeated in order to coat 2 layers in total. A lithography step is performed using the Raith 100 exposing the resist to \qty{400}{\micro\coulomb\per\square\cm}. The resist is developed using a 1:3 mixture of MIBK and isopropanol for \qty{45}{\s}, the development is stopped using isopropanol. The Z-407 sputtering machine deposits a \qty{5}{\nm} \ce{MoGe} sticking layer followed by a \qty{500}{\nm} \ce{Au} layer. The lift-off is performed in acetone.

Inside of the inner loop of the coil, we mill a hole of roughly \qty{30}{\um} deep with a diameter of \qty{40}{\um} in the \ce{Si} substrate using a \ce{Ga} FIB. A similar hole is also made in a microscope coverslip. A \ce{NdFeB} particle of roughly \qty{30}{\um} is placed inside the \ce{Si} hole and the coverslip is placed on top of the \ce{Si} substrate. The holes are carefully aligned by moving the coverslip using a microneedle. The coverslip is then glued to the \ce{Si} substrate using an epoxy.
