In this thesis we regularly have to project 3D structures onto a 2D plane. To clarify the x-, y- and z-directions, they have been color coded. This is done consistently throughout the thesis and matches with the colors assigned to the axes by COMSOL. The x-direction is colored in \textcolor{x_axis_color}{red}, the y-direction in \textcolor{y_axis_color}{green} and the z-direction in \textcolor{blue}{blue}. Additionally an attempt has been made to optimize figures for colorblind readers based on Paul Tol's color schemes\cite{paul_tol}.

Furthermore, when a damping rate ($\gamma$) or Q-factor is given, we use the following definition:
\begin{equation*}
    Q = \omega_0 \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{dissipation}} = \frac{\omega_0}{\gamma}
\end{equation*}
where $\omega_0$ is the resonance frequency. More information on the definition and conversion of Q-factors can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:q_factors}.
