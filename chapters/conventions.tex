\label{chap:conventions}
In this thesis we regularly have to project 3D structures onto a 2D plane. To clarify the x-, y- and z-directions they have been color coded. This is done consistently throughout the thesis and matches with the colors assigned to the axes by COMSOL. The x-direction is colored in \textcolor{x_axis_color}{red}, the y-direction in \textcolor{y_axis_color}{green} and the z-direction in \textcolor{blue}{blue}. Additionally an attempt has been made to optimize figures for colorblind readers based on Paul Tol's color schemes\cite{paul_tol}.
